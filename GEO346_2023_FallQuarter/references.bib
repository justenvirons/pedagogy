  abstract = {Despite consistent reports of large-scale declines in air pollution over the past several decades in the US, those declines have not been consistent across the landscape. Low-income and African American communities consistently remain exposed to higher levels of air pollution than non-Hispanic whites (Arde, 2015). Researchers have pointed to inequalities in environmental exposure as one contributor to racial disparities in health outcomes across the US (Juarez et al., 2014). This chapter explores the potential role of air pollution hotspots in creating and maintaining health disparities over time. Focusing on EPA Region 5 (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin), we analyze the demographic characteristics of those block groups that were consistently hotspots for air pollution health risk for the four years following the Executive Order 12898 aimed at addressing these disparities. Estimates of the health risk of 572 industrial air toxics were obtained from the EPA Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Geographic Microdata (RSEI-GM). We find that the likelihood that an area becomes a hotspot, and the likelihood that it remains a hotspot over time is influenced by race and income. Block groups with greater percentage of low income African-Americans and Whites were more likely to become a hotspot over the time period studied. Block groups with a greater percentage of African-American residents were significantly more likely to remain hotspots over time, whereas hotspots with greater percentage of Hispanic residents were more likely to lose their hotspot status. This study revealed important information about the populations that are consistently exposed to toxic hotspots\textemdash and thus at the greatest risk for poor health outcomes. This is one step in understanding the potential role of hotspots in creating and maintaining disparities in health.},
